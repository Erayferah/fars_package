This is a repository for the package FARS, which was the final task in building
R packages course in Coursera.

In this package, there are couple of functions which would be helpful to load, 
rename, investigate, summarize and plot the data from the US National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS).

In order to see how to use function, please check man/ folder where you could 
see examples for each function.
